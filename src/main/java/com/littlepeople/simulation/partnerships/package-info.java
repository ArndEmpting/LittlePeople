/**
 * Partnership and Family Formation System for LittlePeople Simulation Engine.
 *
 * <p>This package implements RFC-005: Partnerships and Family Formation, providing
 * comprehensive systems for romantic relationship formation, marriage ceremonies,
 * family creation, and multi-generational relationship tracking.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Core Components</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Partnership System:</strong> Manages romantic relationship formation
 *       based on compatibility algorithms, age appropriateness, and personality matching</li>
 *   <li><strong>Marriage System:</strong> Handles marriage proposals, wedding ceremonies,
 *       legal status tracking, and divorce proceedings</li>
 *   <li><strong>Family Formation:</strong> Manages pregnancy, childbirth, genetic
 *       inheritance, and multi-generational family tree construction</li>
 *   <li><strong>Event Processing:</strong> Integrates with the RFC-003 event system
 *       for all relationship and family lifecycle events</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Key Features</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Personality-based compatibility calculations</li>
 *   <li>Age-appropriate partnership matching with life stage constraints</li>
 *   <li>Realistic fertility modeling with age-based decline</li>
 *   <li>Genetic trait inheritance from parents to children</li>
 *   <li>Efficient family tree navigation and relationship tracking</li>
 *   <li>Marriage ceremony events and legal status management</li>
 *   <li>Divorce mechanics with property and custody considerations</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Biological Constraints</h2>
 * <p>The system implements realistic biological constraints including:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Age-based fertility decline (peak fertility 20-30, decline after 35)</li>
 *   <li>Gender-based pregnancy limitations (only females can become pregnant)</li>
 *   <li>Health status impact on fertility and pregnancy outcomes</li>
 *   <li>Realistic pregnancy duration (approximately 9 months)</li>
 *   <li>Genetic diversity through trait combination algorithms</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
 * <p>The partnership system is optimized for large populations with:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Efficient partner matching algorithms using indexed searches</li>
 *   <li>Memory-optimized family tree data structures</li>
 *   <li>Concurrent-safe relationship updates</li>
 *   <li>Event-driven processing to minimize computational overhead</li>
 * </ul>
