# Implementation Prompt for RFC-003: Simulation Clock and Event System

## Overview

This implementation prompt provides guidance for implementing RFC-003: Simulation Clock and Event System. The RFC describes the time management and event processing foundation that drives the LittlePeople simulation engine, including the simulation clock, event system, and temporal mechanics.

## Implementation Requirements

Please implement the features described in RFC-003 according to the following guidelines:

1. **Follow the Design Specifications**: Adhere strictly to the design, architecture, and interface specifications provided in the RFC document.
   - Implement the SimulationClock with time progression and control mechanisms
   - Create the Event system with scheduling, processing, and lifecycle management
   - Establish the EventProcessor interface and implementation framework

2. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Follow all coding standards and conventions defined in RULES.md
   - Include comprehensive error handling and logging using SLF4J
   - Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments and JavaDoc
   - Avoid code duplication and excessive complexity
   - Implement required unit tests with minimum 85% coverage

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Optimize event scheduling and processing for large event volumes
   - Use efficient data structures for event queues and time management
   - Consider memory usage for long-running simulations
   - Implement proper event cleanup and garbage collection

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Include JavaDoc for all public classes and methods
   - Document event processing workflows and timing mechanics
   - Create package-info.java files explaining system purposes
   - Document temporal algorithms and scheduling strategies

5. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Implement unit tests for clock operations and event processing
   - Test event scheduling, execution, and cleanup scenarios
   - Include timing-sensitive test cases with proper synchronization
   - Test error handling and recovery in event processing
   - Validate event ordering and temporal consistency

6. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Build upon the architectural foundation from RFC-001
   - Integrate with Person entities from RFC-002
   - Use the logging framework and exception hierarchy from RFC-001
   - Follow the established package structure and design patterns

## Deliverables

Your implementation should include:

1. SimulationClock implementation with:
   - Time progression control (play, pause, step, speed adjustment)
   - Current time tracking and calendar functionality
   - Time-based event triggering mechanisms
   - Clock state management and persistence support

2. Event system implementation with:
   - Event base classes and interfaces
   - Event scheduling and queue management
   - Event processor framework and registration
   - Event lifecycle management (create, schedule, execute, cleanup)

3. Core event types for simulation:
   - TimeAdvanceEvent for clock progression
   - PersonEvent base class for person-related events
   - SystemEvent for simulation control events
   - Extensible event type framework

4. Event processing infrastructure:
   - EventQueue with priority and timing support
   - EventDispatcher for routing events to processors
   - EventScheduler for future event planning
   - Event execution engine with error handling

5. Unit tests for all implemented components with 85%+ coverage:
   - Clock operations and time management testing
   - Event scheduling and processing testing
   - Event processor registration and execution testing
   - Error handling and recovery scenario testing

## Technical Focus Areas

### Time Management
- Implement precise time tracking and progression mechanisms
- Design efficient calendar and date/time operations
- Create configurable time step and simulation speed controls
- Handle time zone and calendar complexities if required

### Event Architecture
- Design extensible event hierarchy for different event types
- Implement efficient event scheduling and priority management
- Create robust event processing pipeline with error handling
- Design event persistence and recovery mechanisms

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize event queue operations for large volumes
- Implement efficient event lookup and retrieval mechanisms
- Design memory-efficient event storage and cleanup
- Consider concurrent processing capabilities for future expansion

### Error Handling and Recovery
- Implement comprehensive error handling for event processing failures
- Design recovery mechanisms for interrupted or failed events
- Create event rollback and compensation strategies
- Provide detailed error reporting and logging for debugging

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be considered successful when:

1. SimulationClock provides accurate time management and control
2. Event system handles scheduling, processing, and cleanup correctly
3. Event processors can be registered and executed properly
4. Time progression works correctly with event triggering
5. Unit tests achieve minimum 85% code coverage
6. All acceptance criteria from RFC-003 are met
7. Integration with RFC-001 and RFC-002 is seamless
8. Performance requirements for event processing are met

## Quality Gates

Before considering the implementation complete, ensure:

- All RFC-003 acceptance criteria are validated
- Code quality standards from RULES.md are followed
- Event system supports scalability requirements
- Time management is accurate and reliable
- Event processing handles error conditions gracefully
- Documentation is complete for all timing and event systems
- Test coverage targets are achieved with comprehensive scenarios

## Integration Notes

This RFC builds upon RFC-001 (foundation) and RFC-002 (entities) to create the temporal engine that will drive all simulation activity. Pay special attention to:

- EventProcessor interface - must integrate with the interface hierarchy from RFC-001
- Event handling for Person entities - events will operate on the Person class from RFC-002
- Logging integration - extensive logging of event processing using RFC-001 framework
- Package organization - events go in com.littlepeople.simulation.events package
- Exception handling - use simulation-specific exceptions from RFC-001 hierarchy

The event system and simulation clock created here will be essential for RFC-004 (Life Cycle), RFC-005 (Partnerships), and all subsequent simulation features that require time-based processing.
