# LittlePeople - Request for Comments (RFC) Implementation Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Project:** LittlePeople Life Simulation Engine  

## Implementation Sequence Overview

This document outlines the complete sequence of RFCs (Request for Comments) for implementing the LittlePeople simulation engine. These RFCs are designed to be implemented **strictly in sequential order**, with each RFC building upon the foundation established by previous RFCs.

## Dependency Graph

The following diagram illustrates the dependencies between RFCs:

```
RFC-001 (Project Setup)
    ?
RFC-002 (Core Models)
    ?
RFC-003 (Simulation Clock & Event System) ? Basic foundation
    ?
RFC-004 (Life Cycle - Aging & Mortality)
    ?
RFC-005 (Partnerships & Family Formation) ? Core simulation complete
    ?
RFC-006 (Population Management) 
    ?
RFC-007 (Configuration System)
    ?
RFC-008 (Simulation Control Interface) ? Basic functionality complete
    ?
RFC-009 (Persistence Layer)
    ?
RFC-010 (Console UI)
    ?
RFC-011 (Statistics & Reporting) ? MVP complete
    ?
RFC-012 (Extension Framework) ? Future expansion ready
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
- **RFC-001:** Project Setup and Architecture

- **RFC-011:** Statistics and Reporting

### Phase 5: Extension
- **RFC-012:** Extension Framework

## Critical Path and Sequential Implementation

The RFCs are designed for strict sequential implementation. Each RFC **MUST** be fully implemented before proceeding to the next. The critical path dependencies are:

1. Core Models (RFC-002) ? All subsequent RFCs
2. Simulation Clock & Event System (RFC-003) ? Life Cycle Features (RFC-004, RFC-005)
3. Life Cycle Features (RFC-004, RFC-005) ? Population Management (RFC-006)
4. Population Management (RFC-006) ? Simulation Control (RFC-008)
5. Simulation Control (RFC-008) ? Console UI (RFC-010)
6. Persistence Layer (RFC-009) ? Statistics & Reporting (RFC-011)

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Sequential Order:** RFCs MUST be implemented in numerical order (001, 002, 003...)
2. **Complete Implementation:** Each RFC must be completely implemented before proceeding
3. **Acceptance Criteria:** All criteria in each RFC must be satisfied
4. **Testing:** Maintain >85% test coverage for all implemented features
5. **Documentation:** Update documentation with each RFC
6. **Performance:** Consider performance implications with each implementation
