# Implementation Prompt for RFC-005: Partnerships and Family Formation

## Overview

This implementation prompt provides guidance for implementing RFC-005: Partnerships and Family Formation. The RFC describes the partnership and family formation systems that enable inhabitants to form relationships, get married, and have children, creating the foundation for multi-generational family structures.

## Implementation Requirements

Please implement the features described in RFC-005 according to the following guidelines:

1. **Follow the Design Specifications**: Adhere strictly to the design, architecture, and interface specifications provided in the RFC document.
   - Implement the partnership system with relationship formation and management
   - Create the marriage system with ceremony events and legal status tracking
   - Establish the childbirth and family formation mechanisms

2. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Follow all coding standards and conventions defined in RULES.md
   - Include comprehensive error handling and logging using SLF4J
   - Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments and JavaDoc
   - Avoid code duplication and excessive complexity
   - Implement required unit tests with minimum 85% coverage

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Optimize relationship matching algorithms for large populations
   - Use efficient data structures for family tree management
   - Consider memory usage for multi-generational family tracking
   - Implement efficient partner selection and compatibility calculations

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Include JavaDoc for all public classes and methods
   - Document relationship algorithms and compatibility calculations
   - Create package-info.java files explaining partnership system purposes
   - Document family formation rules and biological constraints

5. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Implement unit tests for relationship formation and management
   - Test marriage ceremonies and legal status changes
   - Include childbirth probability and family formation testing
   - Test family tree construction and relationship tracking
   - Validate age and life stage constraints for partnerships

6. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Build upon the life cycle system from RFC-004 for age-appropriate partnerships
   - Integrate with Person entities from RFC-002 for relationship tracking
   - Use the event system from RFC-003 for relationship and family events
   - Follow established architectural patterns from RFC-001

## Deliverables

Your implementation should include:

1. Partnership system implementation with:
   - Relationship formation based on compatibility algorithms
   - Dating and courtship progression mechanics
   - Partner selection with age, personality, and preference matching
   - Relationship status tracking and progression

2. Marriage system implementation with:
   - Marriage proposal and acceptance mechanics
   - Wedding ceremony event generation and processing
   - Legal marriage status tracking and benefits
   - Divorce mechanics and property/custody considerations

3. Family formation system with:
   - Pregnancy probability calculations based on age and health
   - Pregnancy progression and childbirth events
   - Genetic trait inheritance from parents to children
   - Multi-generational family tree construction and maintenance

4. Relationship event processors:
   - PartnershipEventProcessor for relationship formation and changes
   - MarriageEventProcessor for wedding and divorce events
   - ChildbirthEventProcessor for pregnancy and birth events
   - FamilyEventProcessor for family structure changes

5. Unit tests for all implemented components with 85%+ coverage:
   - Partnership formation and compatibility testing
   - Marriage and divorce process testing
   - Childbirth and family formation testing
   - Family tree construction and relationship tracking testing
   - Event processor integration testing

## Technical Focus Areas

### Compatibility Algorithms
- Implement personality-based compatibility calculations
- Design age-appropriate partnership matching
- Create preference and attraction modeling systems
- Handle edge cases in relationship formation and rejection

### Family Tree Management
- Design efficient family relationship tracking data structures
- Implement genetic trait inheritance algorithms
- Create multi-generational family tree navigation
- Handle complex family relationships (step-families, adoptions)

### Biological Modeling
- Implement realistic pregnancy probability calculations
- Design age-based fertility decline modeling
- Create genetic trait combination and inheritance rules
- Handle biological constraints and medical considerations

### Event Integration
- Design comprehensive relationship and family event scheduling
- Implement proper event sequencing for family formation
- Create event cleanup for relationship changes and family dissolution
- Handle concurrent relationship events and conflicts

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Partnership system successfully matches compatible individuals
2. Marriage system handles ceremonies and legal status changes correctly
3. Family formation creates realistic multi-generational families
4. Family trees accurately track relationships across generations
5. All relationship events integrate properly with the event system
6. Biological constraints are realistically modeled and enforced
7. Unit tests achieve minimum 85% code coverage
8. All acceptance criteria from RFC-005 are met

## Quality Gates

Before considering the implementation complete, ensure:

- All RFC-005 acceptance criteria are validated
- Code quality standards from RULES.md are followed
- Compatibility algorithms produce realistic relationship outcomes
- Family formation follows biological and social constraints
- Event integration works correctly with RFC-003 event system
- Family tree data structures are efficient and accurate
- Documentation covers all relationship and family algorithms

## Integration Notes

This RFC builds upon RFC-001 (foundation), RFC-002 (entities), RFC-003 (events), and RFC-004 (lifecycle) to create the social and family dynamics of the simulation. Pay special attention to:

- Life stage integration - partnerships must respect age and life stage constraints from RFC-004
- Person entity relationships - family relationships must update RFC-002 Person entity connections
- Event processing - use RFC-003 event system for all relationship and family changes
- Biological realism - pregnancy and childbirth must follow realistic biological constraints
- Package organization - partnership code goes in com.littlepeople.simulation.partnerships package

The partnership and family systems created here will be essential for creating multi-generational populations and will be used by RFC-006 (Population Management) and all subsequent features that involve family dynamics and generational progression.
