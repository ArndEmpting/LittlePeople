# Implementation Prompt for RFC-010: User Interface System

## Overview

This implementation prompt provides guidance for implementing RFC-010: User Interface System. The RFC describes the comprehensive console-based user interface system that provides an intuitive command-line interface for story writers to interact with all simulation features, including configuration management, simulation control, population browsing, reporting, and data export.

## Implementation Requirements

Please implement the features described in RFC-010 according to the following guidelines:

1. **Follow the Design Specifications**: Adhere strictly to the design, architecture, and interface specifications provided in the RFC document.
   - Implement the modular UI architecture with clear separation between command processing, display, and session management
   - Create the comprehensive command system with all specified command categories
   - Establish the display framework with ASCII tables, charts, and progress indicators

2. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Follow all coding standards and conventions defined in RULES.md
   - Include comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error messages
   - Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments and JavaDoc
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization for security
   - Implement required unit tests with minimum 85% coverage

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Ensure sub-100ms response times for simple commands
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Use lazy loading for expensive operations
   - Cache frequently accessed display data appropriately

4. **User Experience Requirements**:
   - Provide intuitive command structure following CLI conventions
   - Include comprehensive help system with examples
   - Implement clear error messages with actionable guidance
   - Support both interactive and batch operation modes
   - Ensure graceful degradation across different terminal environments

5. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Integrate with all previous RFC implementations (001-009)
   - Provide access to all simulation engine capabilities
   - Maintain session state consistency across commands
   - Implement proper cleanup and resource management

6. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Implement unit tests for all command processors and display components
   - Create integration tests for complete user workflows
   - Include user acceptance tests covering all primary use cases
   - Test error handling and recovery scenarios
   - Validate performance benchmarks for all operations

## Deliverables

Your implementation should include:

1. Complete console application framework with main entry point
2. Full command system with all specified command categories
3. Display framework with tables, charts, and progress indicators
4. Session management and user preference handling
5. Comprehensive help system with context-sensitive assistance
6. Input validation and security measures
7. Error handling with clear user feedback
8. Configuration management for UI preferences
9. Unit tests for all components with 90%+ coverage
10. Integration tests for complete user workflows
