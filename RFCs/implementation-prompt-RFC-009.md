# Implementation Prompt for RFC-009: Persistence Layer

## Overview

This implementation prompt provides guidance for implementing RFC-009: Persistence Layer. The RFC describes the persistence layer that establishes how simulation states, including all inhabitants, relationships, events, and configuration settings are saved, loaded, and managed, providing efficient storage and retrieval of large populations while maintaining relationship consistency and supporting different database backends.

## Implementation Requirements

Please implement the features described in RFC-009 according to the following guidelines:

1. **Follow the Design Specifications**: Adhere strictly to the design, architecture, and interface specifications provided in the RFC document.
   - Implement the PersistenceManager as the central coordination component
   - Create the SimulationRepository for complete simulation state management
   - Establish entity-specific repositories (PersonRepository, EventRepository, etc.)
   - Build the DataIntegrityValidator for data consistency verification

2. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Follow all coding standards and conventions defined in RULES.md
   - Include comprehensive error handling and logging using SLF4J
   - Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments and JavaDoc
   - Avoid code duplication and excessive complexity
   - Implement required unit tests with minimum 85% coverage

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Optimize database operations for large population datasets
   - Use efficient batch processing for bulk operations
   - Consider memory usage for large data loading and saving
   - Implement connection pooling and transaction management

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Include JavaDoc for all public classes and methods
   - Document database schema design and entity mappings
   - Create package-info.java files explaining persistence purposes
   - Document migration strategies and data integrity procedures

5. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Implement unit tests for all repository operations
   - Test data integrity validation and consistency checks
   - Include performance testing for large dataset operations
   - Test database migration and schema evolution
   - Validate transaction management and rollback scenarios

6. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Build upon the simulation control from RFC-008 for save/load operations
   - Integrate with the configuration system from RFC-007 for persistence settings
   - Use all entity models from previous RFCs for data persistence
   - Follow established architectural patterns from RFC-001

## Deliverables

Your implementation should include:

1. PersistenceManager implementation with:
   - Central coordination of all persistence operations

   - Data validation and integrity checking

3. Entity-specific repositories:
   - PersonRepository for population data persistence
   - EventRepository for event history storage
   - ConfigurationRepository for configuration persistence
   - RelationshipRepository for family structure storage

4. DatabaseConnector implementation with:
   - Database-agnostic connection management
   - Query execution and result processing
   - Connection pooling and performance optimization
   - Database-specific adapter support (SQLite, PostgreSQL)

5. DataIntegrityValidator implementation with:
   - Data consistency validation rules
   - Foreign key integrity checking
   - Orphaned data detection and cleanup
   - Data corruption detection and reporting

6. MigrationManager implementation with:
   - Database schema migration and versioning
   - Data transformation during upgrades
   - Rollback capabilities for failed migrations
   - Migration validation and testing

7. Data mapping components:
   - Entity-to-database mapping definitions
   - Serialization and deserialization handlers
   - Type conversion and data transformation
   - Custom field mapping for complex data types

8. Unit tests for all implemented components with 85%+ coverage:
   - Repository operation testing
   - Data integrity validation testing
   - Migration and schema evolution testing
   - Performance testing for large datasets
   - Transaction management testing

## Technical Focus Areas

### Database Abstraction

- Design efficient query generation and execution
- Create database-specific adapter pattern implementation
- Handle database-specific optimizations and features

### Data Integrity Management
- Implement comprehensive data validation and consistency checking
- Design foreign key relationship management
- Create orphaned data detection and cleanup mechanisms
- Handle data corruption detection and recovery

### Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient batch processing for large datasets
- Design connection pooling and resource management
- Create indexing strategies for optimal query performance
- Handle memory-efficient data loading and streaming

### Migration and Versioning
- Design robust database schema migration system
- Implement data transformation during version upgrades
- Create rollback mechanisms for failed migrations
- Handle backward compatibility and version detection

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Complete simulation states can be saved and loaded reliably
2. Data integrity is maintained across all persistence operations
3. Performance requirements are met for large population datasets
4. Database migrations work correctly with version compatibility
5. All entity relationships are preserved during persistence
6. Transaction management ensures data consistency
7. Unit tests achieve minimum 85% code coverage
8. All acceptance criteria from RFC-009 are met

## Quality Gates

Before considering the implementation complete, ensure:

- All RFC-009 acceptance criteria are validated
- Code quality standards from RULES.md are followed
- Database operations maintain ACID properties
- Data integrity validation is comprehensive and accurate
- Performance benchmarks are met for all operations
- Migration system handles all upgrade scenarios correctly
- Documentation covers all persistence operations and schemas

## Integration Notes

This RFC builds upon all previous RFCs (001-008) to provide comprehensive data persistence for the entire simulation system. Pay special attention to:

- Entity integration - persist all entities from RFC-002 through RFC-006
- Configuration persistence - save/load RFC-007 configuration data
- Control state persistence - integrate with RFC-008 simulation control state
- Event system integration - use RFC-003 events for persistence notifications
- Package organization - persistence code goes in com.littlepeople.persistence package

The persistence layer created here will be essential for RFC-010 (User Interface System) which will provide user access to save/load operations, completing the full simulation engine with persistent data storage capabilities.
