# Implementation Prompt for RFC-006: Population Management

## Overview

This implementation prompt provides guidance for implementing RFC-006: Population Management. The RFC describes the population management system that establishes how the initial population is generated, how immigration and emigration are handled, and how the overall population is managed throughout the simulation with realistic demographic patterns.

## Implementation Requirements

Please implement the features described in RFC-006 according to the following guidelines:

1. **Follow the Design Specifications**: Adhere strictly to the design, architecture, and interface specifications provided in the RFC document.
   - Implement the PopulationManager as the central coordination component
   - Create the PopulationGenerator for initial and immigrant population creation
   - Establish the PopulationGrowthController for immigration/emigration management
   - Build the DemographicValidator for population consistency checks

2. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Follow all coding standards and conventions defined in RULES.md
   - Include comprehensive error handling and logging using SLF4J
   - Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments and JavaDoc
   - Avoid code duplication and excessive complexity
   - Implement required unit tests with minimum 85% coverage

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Optimize population generation algorithms for large initial populations
   - Use efficient data structures for demographic tracking and validation
   - Consider memory usage for population-wide operations
   - Implement efficient population search and filtering mechanisms

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Include JavaDoc for all public classes and methods
   - Document population generation algorithms and demographic distribution logic
   - Create package-info.java files explaining population management purposes
   - Document immigration/emigration rules and validation constraints

5. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Implement unit tests for population generation and management
   - Test demographic distribution algorithms and validation rules
   - Include statistical testing for population distribution accuracy
   - Test immigration/emigration processes and edge cases
   - Validate integration with family formation from RFC-005

6. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Build upon the partnership and family systems from RFC-005
   - Integrate with Person entities from RFC-002 for population tracking
   - Use the event system from RFC-003 for population-related events
   - Follow established architectural patterns from RFC-001

## Deliverables

Your implementation should include:

1. PopulationManager implementation with:
   - Central coordination of all population operations
   - Population initialization and ongoing management
   - Integration with configuration system for population parameters
   - Population query and reporting capabilities

2. PopulationGenerator implementation with:
   - Initial population creation with realistic demographic distributions
   - Age distribution modeling based on real-world demographics
   - Gender distribution with configurable ratios
   - Initial family structure generation with appropriate relationships

3. PopulationGrowthController implementation with:
   - Immigration process with configurable rates and demographics
   - Emigration process with realistic departure patterns
   - Population growth monitoring and control
   - Demographic balance maintenance

4. DemographicValidator implementation with:
   - Population consistency validation rules
   - Age distribution validation against realistic patterns
   - Family structure integrity checks
   - Population size and growth rate validation

5. Population event processors:
   - ImmigrationEventProcessor for new arrival processing
   - EmigrationEventProcessor for departure handling
   - PopulationGrowthEventProcessor for growth monitoring
   - DemographicValidationEventProcessor for consistency checks

6. Unit tests for all implemented components with 85%+ coverage:
   - Population generation and distribution testing
   - Immigration/emigration process testing
   - Demographic validation rule testing
   - Population management integration testing
   - Event processor integration testing

## Technical Focus Areas

### Population Generation Algorithms
- Implement statistically accurate age distribution modeling
- Design realistic family structure generation algorithms
- Create gender distribution with configurable parameters
- Handle edge cases in initial population creation

### Demographic Management
- Create efficient demographic tracking and reporting systems
- Implement population growth rate monitoring and control
- Design demographic validation rules based on real-world constraints
- Handle population imbalances and correction mechanisms

### Immigration/Emigration Systems
- Implement realistic immigration patterns and demographics
- Design emigration algorithms based on life circumstances
- Create population flow monitoring and reporting
- Handle edge cases in population movement

### Integration with Family Systems
- Ensure population management respects family relationships from RFC-005
- Integrate population generation with partnership and family formation
- Maintain consistency between population-level and individual-level operations
- Handle multi-generational family considerations in population management

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Population generation creates realistic demographic distributions
2. Immigration/emigration processes maintain population balance
3. Demographic validation ensures population consistency
4. Population management integrates seamlessly with family systems
5. All population events integrate properly with the event system
6. Population operations scale efficiently for large populations
7. Unit tests achieve minimum 85% code coverage
8. All acceptance criteria from RFC-006 are met

## Quality Gates

Before considering the implementation complete, ensure:

- All RFC-006 acceptance criteria are validated
- Code quality standards from RULES.md are followed
- Population generation algorithms produce realistic demographic patterns
- Immigration/emigration processes maintain demographic balance
- Integration with RFC-005 family systems works correctly
- Population validation rules are comprehensive and accurate
- Documentation covers all population management algorithms

## Integration Notes

This RFC builds upon RFC-001 (foundation), RFC-002 (entities), RFC-003 (events), RFC-004 (lifecycle), and RFC-005 (partnerships) to create comprehensive population-level management. Pay special attention to:

- Family system integration - population management must work with RFC-005 family formation
- Person entity integration - population operations must work with RFC-002 Person entities
- Event processing - use RFC-003 event system for all population-related changes
- Lifecycle integration - population management must respect RFC-004 lifecycle constraints
- Package organization - population code goes in com.littlepeople.simulation.population package

The population management system created here will be essential for RFC-007 (Configuration System) which needs population parameters, and subsequent features that require population-level operations and reporting.
