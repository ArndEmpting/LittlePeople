## Integration Notes

This RFC builds upon RFC-001 (foundation), RFC-009 (persistence), RFC-010 (UI), and RFC-006 (population) to provide comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities. Pay special attention to:

- Data access integration - use RFC-009 persistence layer for all data retrieval
- UI integration - reports must be accessible through RFC-010 user interface
- Population data integration - work with RFC-006 population management for current data
- Performance optimization - handle large datasets efficiently without impacting simulation
- Package organization - reporting code goes in com.littlepeople.reporting package

The statistics and reporting system created here completes the MVP implementation, providing users with comprehensive insights into their simulated populations and enabling data-driven storytelling through detailed analytics and reporting capabilities.
