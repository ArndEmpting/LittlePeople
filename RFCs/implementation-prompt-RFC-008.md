# Implementation Prompt for RFC-008: Simulation Control Interface

## Overview

This implementation prompt provides guidance for implementing RFC-008: Simulation Control Interface. The RFC describes the simulation control interface that establishes how users interact with and control the simulation, providing mechanisms to start, pause, resume, and step through the simulation at various speeds, acting as the primary control layer between the user and the simulation engine.

## Implementation Requirements

Please implement the features described in RFC-008 according to the following guidelines:

1. **Follow the Design Specifications**: Adhere strictly to the design, architecture, and interface specifications provided in the RFC document.
   - Implement the SimulationController as the central coordination component
   - Create the UserFeedbackProvider for status updates and progress information
   - Establish the BookmarkManager for simulation state bookmarking
   - Build the SpeedController for simulation execution speed management

2. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Follow all coding standards and conventions defined in RULES.md
   - Include comprehensive error handling and logging using SLF4J
   - Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments and JavaDoc
   - Avoid code duplication and excessive complexity
   - Implement required unit tests with minimum 85% coverage

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Optimize simulation control operations for responsive user interaction
   - Use efficient state management for simulation control states
   - Consider memory usage for bookmark storage and management
   - Implement non-blocking control operations where possible

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Include JavaDoc for all public classes and methods
   - Document simulation control workflows and state transitions
   - Create package-info.java files explaining control system purposes
   - Document bookmark management and speed control algorithms

5. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Implement unit tests for simulation control operations
   - Test state transitions and control command handling
   - Include timing-sensitive test cases for speed control
   - Test bookmark creation, management, and navigation
   - Validate integration with configuration and event systems

6. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Build upon the configuration system from RFC-007 for control parameters
   - Integrate with the population management from RFC-006 for simulation control
   - Use the event system from RFC-003 for control event processing
   - Follow established architectural patterns from RFC-001

6. Control event processors:
   - SimulationStartEventProcessor for start command handling
   - SimulationPauseEventProcessor for pause command handling
   - SimulationResumeEventProcessor for resume command handling
   - SimulationStepEventProcessor for step command handling
   - SimulationSeekEventProcessor for seek command handling
   - SimulationSpeedChangeEventProcessor for speed change handling

7. Unit tests for all implemented components with 85%+ coverage:
   - Simulation control command testing
   - State transition validation testing
   - Bookmark management testing
   - Speed control testing
   - Integration testing with event and configuration systems

## Technical Focus Areas

### Control State Management

- Design efficient state transition mechanisms
- Create thread-safe state management for concurrent access
- Handle edge cases in state transitions and error recovery

### Command Processing
- Design responsive command processing architecture
- Implement command validation and error handling
- Create command queuing and prioritization mechanisms
- Handle concurrent command execution and conflicts

### Bookmark System
- Implement efficient bookmark storage and retrieval
- Design bookmark metadata management and organization
- Create bookmark validation and integrity checking
- Handle bookmark versioning and compatibility

### Speed Control
- Implement precise speed calculation and application
- Design real-time speed adjustment mechanisms
- Create speed monitoring and performance impact assessment
- Handle speed limit enforcement and validation

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Simulation control commands execute reliably and responsively
2. State transitions work correctly with proper validation
3. Bookmark system creates, stores, and restores simulation states accurately
4. Speed control adjusts simulation execution speed as expected
5. User feedback provides clear and timely status information
6. All control events integrate properly with the event system
7. Unit tests achieve minimum 85% code coverage
8. All acceptance criteria from RFC-008 are met

## Quality Gates

Before considering the implementation complete, ensure:

- All RFC-008 acceptance criteria are validated
- Code quality standards from RULES.md are followed
- Simulation control operations are responsive and reliable
- State management handles all edge cases and error conditions
- Bookmark system maintains simulation state integrity
- Speed control provides accurate and stable speed adjustment
- Documentation covers all control operations and workflows

## Integration Notes

This RFC builds upon RFC-001 (foundation), RFC-003 (events), RFC-006 (population), and RFC-007 (configuration) to provide comprehensive simulation control capabilities. Pay special attention to:

- Event system integration - use RFC-003 events for all control operations
- Configuration integration - use RFC-007 configuration for control parameters
- Clock integration - control operations must work with RFC-003 simulation clock
- State consistency - control operations must maintain simulation state integrity
- Package organization - control code goes in com.littlepeople.simulation.control package

The simulation control interface created here will be essential for RFC-009 (Persistence Layer) which needs control state management, and RFC-010 (User Interface System) which will provide user access to all control operations.
