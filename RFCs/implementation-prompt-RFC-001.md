# Implementation Prompt for RFC-001: Project Setup and Architecture

## Overview

This implementation prompt provides guidance for implementing RFC-001: Project Setup and Architecture. The RFC describes the initial project setup, Maven configuration, package organization, core design patterns, and architectural foundation that will guide the entire LittlePeople simulation engine implementation.

## Implementation Requirements

Please implement the features described in RFC-001 according to the following guidelines:

1. **Follow the Design Specifications**: Adhere strictly to the design, architecture, and interface specifications provided in the RFC document.
   - Implement the modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
   - Set up the five core modules: Core, Simulation, Persistence, UI, and Extensions
   - Establish the design patterns specified in the RFC (Observer, Strategy, Factory, etc.)

2. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Follow all coding standards and conventions defined in RULES.md
   - Include comprehensive error handling and logging using SLF4J
   - Write clear, maintainable code with appropriate comments and JavaDoc
   - Avoid code duplication and excessive complexity
   - Implement required unit tests with minimum 85% coverage

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Establish the foundation for performance monitoring
   - Set up benchmarking framework for future performance testing
   - Consider scalability in core interface designs

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Include JavaDoc for all public classes and methods
   - Document architectural decisions and design patterns
   - Create package-info.java files explaining module purposes
   - Establish documentation standards for future implementations

5. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Implement unit tests for all utility classes and core components
   - Set up the testing framework with JUnit 5
   - Configure JaCoCo for code coverage reporting
   - Follow test naming and organization conventions
   - Include both positive and negative test cases

6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Configure file path handling to be OS-independent
   - Set up logging to use system-appropriate directories
   - Ensure configuration loading works across Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Deliverables

Your implementation should include:

1. Complete Maven project configuration (pom.xml) with proper dependencies:
   - SQLite JDBC for database (MVP)
   - Jackson for configuration parsing
   - SLF4J/Logback for logging
   - JUnit 5 for testing
   - JaCoCo for code coverage

2. Package structure implementation according to RFC specifications:
   - com.littlepeople.core (model, interfaces, util)
   - com.littlepeople.simulation (engine, events, lifecycle)
   - com.littlepeople.persistence (repository, dao, config)
   - com.littlepeople.ui (console)
   - com.littlepeople.extensions (api, loader)

3. Core interfaces and base classes:
   - Entity interface
   - EventProcessor interface
   - SimulationLifecycle interface

4. Exception hierarchy establishment:
   - SimulationException (base)
   - ConfigurationException
   - EntityNotFoundException
   - PersistenceException
   - SimulationControlException

5. Utility classes for common operations:
   - ValidationUtils
   - ConfigurationUtils

6. Logging configuration (logback.xml):
   - Console appender with appropriate pattern
   - File appender with rolling policy
   - Proper log levels for development and production

7. Unit tests for all implemented components with 85%+ coverage

## Technical Focus Areas

### Maven Configuration
- Set up Java 21 compatibility
- Configure build plugins for compilation, testing, and coverage
- Establish dependency management best practices
- Configure cross-platform build compatibility

### Architectural Foundation
- Implement core interfaces that will be used throughout the system
- Establish design patterns that subsequent RFCs will build upon
- Create utility classes that provide common functionality
- Set up the foundation for dependency injection

### Logging and Monitoring
- Configure comprehensive logging framework
- Establish logging standards and practices
- Set up file rotation and log management
- Create foundation for performance monitoring

### Testing Framework
- Set up JUnit 5 testing framework
- Configure JaCoCo for code coverage reporting
- Establish testing standards and conventions
- Create test utilities for future use

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Maven project builds successfully with `mvn clean install`
2. All base interfaces and exceptions are properly defined
3. Package structure matches RFC specifications exactly
4. Logging works correctly for both console and file output
5. Cross-platform compatibility is verified on multiple operating systems
6. Unit tests achieve minimum 85% code coverage
7. All acceptance criteria from RFC-001 are met
8. Documentation is complete for all interfaces and public APIs

## Quality Gates

Before considering the implementation complete, ensure:

- All RFC-001 acceptance criteria are validated
- Code quality standards from RULES.md are followed
- Performance baseline is established
- Security considerations are addressed
- Cross-platform functionality is tested
- Documentation standards are established
- Test coverage targets are achieved

## Integration Notes

This RFC establishes the foundation that all subsequent RFCs will build upon. Pay special attention to:

- Interface design - these will be extended by future implementations
- Package organization - this structure will house all future code
- Design patterns - these will be used throughout the system
- Build configuration - this must support all future dependencies
- Logging framework - this will be used by all components

The quality of this foundational implementation directly impacts the success of all subsequent RFC implementations.
