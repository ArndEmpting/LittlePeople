# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## LittlePeople - Life Simulation Engine

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Project:** LittlePeople  
**Author:** Product Manager  
**Status:** Implementation Ready

---

## Executive Summary

LittlePeople is a modular life simulation engine designed specifically for hobby story writers who need realistic character backgrounds and family dynamics for their fiction projects. The system simulates village/town populations over multiple generations, providing writers with authentic demographic data, family relationships, and life events that serve as story inspiration.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- Generates realistic multi-generational character backgrounds automatically
- Provides authentic demographic patterns for historical and contemporary fiction
- Offers extensible architecture for future story-writing tools
- Eliminates manual family tree creation and character relationship planning

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Hobby writers struggle to create believable, interconnected character relationships and realistic demographic patterns for their stories. Manual creation of family trees and character backgrounds is time-consuming and often lacks demographic authenticity.

**Desired State:** Writers have access to a simulation tool that generates realistic fictional communities with authentic population dynamics, enabling them to focus on storytelling rather than demographic research and character background creation.

**Success Definition:** Writers can generate a complete fictional community with 50+ years of realistic demographic history in under 30 minutes of setup time.
