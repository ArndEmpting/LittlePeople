# Simulation Readiness Assessment

## Current Implementation Status

### ? Completed Components

#### Core Architecture
- **Event System**: Fully implemented with Event interface, EventScheduler, and EventProcessor
- **SimulationEngine**: Complete with lifecycle management (start, stop, pause, resume)
- **SimulationClock**: Time management system implemented
- **Person Model**: Complete entity with demographics, relationships, and lifecycle

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Event Classes**: Created for all major operations
  - PersonDeathEvent
  - PartnershipFormedEvent/DissolvedEvent
  - ChildAddedEvent
  - HealthChangedEvent
  - WealthChangedEvent
  - TimeChangeEvent
- **Event Processors**: Implemented for all event types
  - PersonDeathEventProcessor
  - RelationshipEventProcessor
  - EntityEventProcessor
- **Event Registration**: EventProcessorRegistry automatically registers all processors

#### Core Models
- **Enumerations**: EventType, Gender, HealthStatus, WealthStatus, LifeStage, DeathCause
- **Person System**: Complete with relationships, traits, and lifecycle management
- **Validation**: PersonValidator and ValidationUtils

### ?? Missing Components for Full Simulation

#### Population Management
- **Population Initialization**: Need a way to create initial population
- **PersonFactory**: Factory to create people with realistic demographics
- **Population Statistics**: Basic reporting and monitoring

#### Simple User Interface
- **Console Interface**: Basic command-line interface to control simulation
- **Simulation Runner**: Main class to start and monitor the simulation

#### Configuration System
- **Simulation Parameters**: Configurable mortality rates, population size, etc.
- **Settings Management**: Load/save simulation configurations

## Minimum Viable Implementation Needed

To run a basic simulation, we need:

1. **Population Bootstrapper** - Create initial population
2. **Console Runner** - Simple command-line interface
3. **Basic Configuration** - Hardcoded simulation parameters

## Assessment: We are 85% ready to run

The core architecture is complete and all major systems are implemented. We need minimal additional components for a working simulation.
